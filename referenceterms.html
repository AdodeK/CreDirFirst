        </p>

        <h4>Site Content - Ownership</h4>

        <p>Except as otherwise noted on the Site, all content and material on the Site, including without limitation,
            all information, photos, podcasts, whitepapers, videos, graphics/charts, icons, code, design, services,
            functions, and overall appearance (collectively, the “Site Content”) is the property of Twelve advisory and
            may not be used, modified, or reproduced without our prior written consent. All copyrights, trade names, and
            logos displayed on the Site are the property of Twelve , its affiliates, or their respective third-party
            owners, and the Site grants no license to them. Site Content may change from time to time. We do not
            guarantee that Site Content is accurate, timely, or has been recently updated. 
        </p>

        <p>Under no circumstances should any Site Content be considered as an offer soliciting the purchase or sale of
            any security or interest in any pooled investment vehicle sponsored, discussed, or mentioned by Twelve nor
            should it be construed as an offer to provide investment advisory services. Such offers or solicitations
            will be made separately and only by means of the confidential offering documents of the specific pooled
            investment vehicles which should be read in their entirety, and only to those who, among other requirements,
            meet certain qualifications under federal securities laws. Such investors, defined as acccredited investors
            and qualified purchasers or qualified clients, are generally deemed capable of evaluating the merits and
            risks of prospective investments and financial matters. There can be no assurances that Twelve 's investment
            objectives will be achieved or investment strategies will be successful. Any investment in a vehicle managed
            by Twelve involves a high degree of risk including the risk that the entire amount invested is lost.
        </p>

        <p>Any investments or portfolio companies described or referred to in the Site are not representative of all
            investments in vehicles managed by Twelve and there can be no assurance that the investments described are,
            or will be, profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar character or results. 
        </p>

        <p>Any opinions expressed in the Site Content reflect Twelve's views or those of the identified posters, and are
            subject to change. Certain information contained in the Site Content has been obtained from third-party
            sources, including from portfolio companies of funds managed by Twelve . While taken from sources believed
            to be reliable, Twelve has not independently verified such information and makes no representations about
            the enduring accuracy of the information or its appropriateness for a given situation. The discussions and
            opinions expressed on the Site are not intended to provide investment, accounting, tax, or legal advice.
            Nothing in any Site Content is or should be interpreted as a recommendation that you purchase, sell or hold
            any security or other investment, or that you pursue any investment style or strategy. All Site Content is
            provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon when making any investment decision.
        </p>

        <p>Certain statements that individual personnel make may constitute “forward-looking statements”. To the extent
            any information herein constitutes forward-looking statements (which can be identified by the use of
            forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipation,” “upside,”
            “potential,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” “forecast,” “target” or “believe” or comparable terminology),
            please note that, due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events, results, or performance may differ
            materially from those reflected or contemplated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are not
            guarantees and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Twelve expressly disclaims any obligation to
            update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate — whether as a result
            of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, prospects
            and/or opinions expressed in these materials are subject to change without notice and may differ or be
            contrary to opinions expressed by others.
        </p>

            parties (“Third Party Sites”); and such Third Party Sites may link to this Site. Twelve has no control over
            the availability, accuracy of content, security, or privacy policies that are contained on or controlled by
            Third Party Sites. We disclaim all liability arising out of or related to such Third Party Sites, and you
            hereby release and hold Twelve harmless from all liability of any kind related to any Third Party Sites. The
            existence of any link to or from a Third Party Site does not constitute an endorsement by Twelve of such
            Third Party Sites, the content thereon, or the Third Party Site owners or operators. Twelve is providing
